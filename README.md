# COMP-Project

This project is a fully interactive, drag-and-drop interface that allows users to build and customize a simulated home screen. Users can create apps, add widgets (clock, weather, calendar, etc.), choose icon colors or images, and even export their layout as an image.

How to run the app locally:

## 1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/kass-lynd/COMP-Project.git
cd COMP-Project

Open the folder with VS Code and select the "Go Live" at the bottom of the interface. If you do not have the "Go Live" and you can acquire it but downloading the Live Server extension.

All user interactions and customizations are saved locally in localStorage.
The app is optimized for desktop usage with mouse input (dragging may be less precise on touch devices).
Designed for experimentation and prototyping UI layouts — no backend required.
